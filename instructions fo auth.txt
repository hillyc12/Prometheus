Description
Everything is great so far, but anybody in the world with the internet access and the URL can visit my Prometheus server and see my data.

To solve this problem, we will add user authentication.

We will use Basic Authentication.

SSH onto your server and CD into your /etc/nginx folder.


cd /etc/nginx
Then install apache2-utils (on ubuntu) or httpd-tools (on centos)


#on ubuntu
sudo apt install apache2-utils

#on centos
sudo yum install httpd-tools
Now we can create a password file. In the command below, I am creating a user called 'admin'.


htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd admin
I then enter a password for the user.

Next open the Nginx Prometheus config file we created.


sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/prometheus
And add the two authentication properties in the examples below to the existing Nginx configuration file we have already created.


server {
    ...

    #addition authentication properties
    auth_basic  "Protected Area";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

    location / {
        proxy_pass           http://localhost:9090/;
    }

    ...
}
Save and test the new configuration has no errors


nginx -t
Restart Nginx


sudo service nginx restart
sudo service nginx status
